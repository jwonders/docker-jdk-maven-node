## Docker Image for JDK, Maven, and NodeJS

Just a simple docker file that combines a JDK, Maven, and NodeJS.

It is intended primarily as a build environment for projects that
rely on npm to build frontend components and maven to build java
backend components without having to run different parts of the
build in different official containers.
